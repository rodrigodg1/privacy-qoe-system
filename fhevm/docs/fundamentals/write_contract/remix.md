# Using Remix

Previously, we had a Remix version working with fhEVM. Since fhEVM v0.5.0, we can no longer maintain this fork, so we are working on a plugin for Remix IDE to interact with fhEVM chains. Stay tuned!

In the meantime, you can use [the official Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) to deploy and interact with your contracts, but without the possibility to encrypt inputs or decrypt ciphertexts.
